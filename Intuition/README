  My apologies for the extreme delay in getting this version out.  Numerous
things interfered, including the shorting-out of my Amiga, which kept me
from getting any work at all done on the extension for about three months.
Since I know there's been clamor for a new version, I'm getting this out
without as thorough testing as I'd like.  I have, however, fixed a number
of bugs reported in versions 1.3 and 1.3a.  As usual, if you find more bugs
(and I suspect you will, in this version...), send me a description of the
bug and sample code that will reproduce it.

  Again, sorry for the delay.
