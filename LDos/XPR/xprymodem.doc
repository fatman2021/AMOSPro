This is an XPR 2.0 implementation of the YMODEM protocol.

based on bmodem: the BIX modem program by David Betz, BYTE Magazine/BIX

changes in:

- v2.00
  - The library is now really pure..
  - Sometimes you could not send files bigger than 256kB. This resulted
    from the wellknown bug useing 16-bit ints and then compiling some
    parts of the code with 32-bit ints..)-:
    The biggest file I sent with v2.00 was the fido-nodelist (ca. 1mB)
    and everything smelled good..

- v1.90
  - Output-option is only used in batch-mode..
  - some people had trouble useing xpr-ymodem in conjunction with
    n-comm v1.92 and atalk3..  > vaporized <  (not the people..;-)
    [ Im KlarText: wenn ein Transfer-Abbruch stattfand, gingen diese zwei
      Proggies in eine hübsche Endlos-Schlaufe, weil sie dummerweise
      JEDESMAL einen Abbruch signalisierten anstatt nur einmal..)-:  ]

- v1.80
  - there was a little error in doc. YMODEM command mode character
    isn't 'M' ,  it's 'Y'    sorry, Urs..
  - added new option: YMODEM -a
    it supports neither CRC nor Checksum and should only be used if
    there are ERROR-DETECTING AND -CORRECTING modems connected..!!
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- v1.65
  - if there's no xpr_fnext(), YMODEM batch doesn't fall back
    in X- / YMODEM state anymore..
  - killed dirty enforcer-hit in XPr-Setup
  - YMODEM-g now stops upload when receiving CAN/CAN   ( NOT standard..!! )
  - YMODEM-g now tests chkabort(), too
  - YMODEM-g now aborts pronto if there occur some dirty errors
  - some code optimations included
  - some incompatibilities excluded

- v1.01
  - better outfit
  - chkabort() implemented

- v1.00
  - first release




technical datas about YMODEM:
- it is an amiga'ized version! It is definetly NOT gronking around
  with single byte reads n' writes or these lame getc() and putc()..!!!!
- it will allways send in binary mode..
- it will use a 16384 bytes internal serial input buffer..
- it will use a  8192 bytes internal IO buffer for file handling..



Enough chatting..


Configurable options are:
  YMODEM mode: Y<S|B|G|A>
  ------------
- 'X- / YMODEM':  you can use this YMODEM as XMODEM, too!              YS
  NOTE:
  YMODEM is fully compatible with XMODEM, so you can use this
  XPr-Y as XPr-X, too..   Ist das nicht Pfanni..(-;

- 'YMODEM batch': the real one & only YMODEM implementation..          YB

- 'YMODEM -g':    for those people wanting good troughput              YG
                  this mode uses 1 kB blocks and CRC-16

- 'YMODEM -a':    for those people wanting best troughput avalaible..  YA
                  this mode uses 2 kB blocks and it does 
                  no CRC-checking, because this is already
                  done by the modems..  [ hail, hail HST..(-; ]

  NOTE:
  -----
   'YMODEM -g' and 'YMODEM -a' work like YMODEM batch, they just
   don't send an ACK for received blocks and they can't handle
   CRC-16 or Checksum errors..
   they should only be used by people with highspeed error-detecting and 
   error-correcting modems..!!  [ ie: US-Robotics HST, etc. ]
  

  by default YB


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CHOP option: Z<1|0>
  ------------
- when enabled, XPrYmodem will chop files ONLY, if the filesize is
  unknown..  you can allways enable this option..

  NOTE: PAD-out char: '\Z' and *NOT* '\0' like xprxmodem.library does..
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  by default enabled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


  OUTPUT option: O<dir>
  --------------
- this specifies the output directory for received files..

  by default RAM:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  CRC option:  C<1|0>
  -----------
- when enabled, XPrYmodem will use CRC-16 for error-checking, else  
  it will use Checksum...

  by default enabled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1kB Blocks:  B<1|0>
  -----------
- when enabled, XPrYmodem will use 1024 bytes data blocks, else 128 bdb's

  by default enabled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This can be overridden by a environment variable, "XPRYMODEM", containing
a setup string, of the following format:
NOTE: this works only, if the comm progi supports it..


these options are seperated by commas. The first character of every field
 is the type, one of:
	B (1k blocks), C (crc), M (YMODEM mode), O (output), Z (chop).

The second char is either 1 or 0, expressing the boolean state of the
option.
	examples:

	Z0,C1,B1  --> chop disabled, crc on, 1k blocks

	Z1,C0,B0  --> chop enabled, crc off (checksum), normal 128byte blocks,

there are two special options:
first char Y  second char:
S  ->  X- / YMODEM
B  ->  batch
G  ->  g mode  (NOT g-spot..:-)
A  ->  ARQ-mode

first char O  argument is the local output directory..   ie: Oram:t

The user might also be prompted for such a string when XProtocolSetUp() is
called, if the comm program does not provide the xpr_options callback
function.
