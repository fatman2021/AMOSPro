                           Super ZModem XPR library
                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                        By Ueli Kaufmann, October '91

This library is 95% identical to the xprzmodem.library from Rick Huebner.
On the assumption that every xpr user would have the xprzmodem.library and
its accompanying documentation, I did not include this documentation in this
archive.

Changes:

I.

The maximum block size is determined by BPS rate, as follows:
  <= 300 BPS =  512 bytes
    1200  "  =  1k
    2400  "  =  2k
    4800  "  =  4k
  >=9600  "  =  8k

Note that not all terminal programs have implemented the xpr standard as well
as term (by Olaf Barthel) or LR-Comm (by myself); this can cause problems when
a false baud rate is signaled to the library.

Therefore, I worked together with Manfred Seiler to develope an 'M' option,
which signifies the maximum block size to send.

Examples:

'M0'    Block size is determined by BPS rate (Default).
'M1'    Sets a max block size of 128 bytes.
'M1024'  Sets a max block size of 1k.
'M2033'  Sets a max block size of 2k. (In this example, an odd block size
of 2033 is given by the user. This size is considered nonsense by the library
and the next largest block is chosen.)

These options only affect uploading. Downloading will always try for 8k
block sizes.

NOTE:  If you use the 'M1024' option with this library, your will
       be 100% compatible with the normal Zmodem.
