                                XPRXMODEM v34.3

A small bug crept into the code, which went undetected, until XPRXmodem
was tested with other versions of XModem.  (Thanks to Scott Velez for
helping to confirm this.)  It has now been fixed.  Following is the
"readme" file from the previous release.  Note the file size is now
12,352 bytes, and I've adapted xcrc.h (from XPRZmodem v2.10) for
XPRXmodem, since it's a bit faster.  Also, MYREVISION is now 36 (libsup.c),
so "version xprxmodem.library" should now correctly, return 34.36.
(I forgot to bump this in v34.2.)

                                        My humble apologies. -- Anthon

                                XPRXMODEM v34.2

Following is an independent (ie by me) update to xprxmodem.library (v34.1),
by Marc Boucher.

The only change is to crc checking, in which, the old method of computing
crc polynomials on the fly, has been replaced with a table of pre-computed
polynomials and the appropriate code (by Marc G. Mendel), reducing the time
between receiving the block & acking it.  Thus, transfers are sped up.
(The really observant will notice the source code was extracted from the
Unsit1.5 archive that I recently uploaded to Unix.source).

Here's some data rates (reported by VLT's update window) for a null modem
setup between two Amigas running VLTjr & xprxmodem (1K blocks with CRC, of
course):

            2400 baud    19200 baud(*)   |   file size
                                         |
     34.1      201           654         |    11,820
                                         |
     34.2      212           796         |    12,332

     Gains      5%           20%         |

Diffs to dlink.c are included for those interested in the code.  Also,
I've bumped up the revision number to v34.2.  The library was compiled and
linked with Manx Aztec C v5.2.

(*) You'll have to look elsewhere for an explanation of why it's
    not 8 times faster...

xprxmodem.library -- version 34.2


This is an XPR 2.0 implementation of the XMODEM protocol.

based on bmodem: the BIX modem program by David Betz, BYTE Magazine/BIX
		(Modified substantially by W.G.J. Langeveld for use in VLT)

Source code modifications and additions needed for XPR are:

By using or distributing this software, you agree to understand and accept
the above.

The desire to move the seldom used xmodem protocol out of VLT, while
maintaining the functionality to those who needed it, motivated this
XPR implementation.

There's nothing really fancy about it.

Configurable options are: Text Mode, CRC, and 1K blocks

They default to "off" (T0,C0,K0).

This can be overridden by a environment variable, "XPRXMODEM", containing
a setup string, of the following format:

3 fields seperated by commas. The first character of every field is the type,
one of:
	T (text mode), C (crc), K (1k blocks).

The second char is either 0 or 1, expressing the boolean state of the
option.
	examples:

	T0,C1,K1 --> text mode off (binary mode), crc on, 1k blocks

	T1,C0,K0 --> text mode, crc off (checksum), normal 128byte blocks

The user might also be prompted for such a string when XProtocolSetUp() is
called, if the comm program does not provide the xpr_options callback
function.

If xpr_finfo is implemented in the terminal program, then it is used
to get the file type and the Text Mode field in the setup string is
ignored.
